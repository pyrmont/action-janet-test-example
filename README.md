# action-janet-test Example

This is the repository of an example Janet project that includes a GitHub
Workflow that uses the [action-janet-test][] GitHub Action.

The [action-janet-test][] GitHub Action sets up janet and jpm, installs any
necessary dependencies and then runs `jpm test`. More information is available
in the action's repository.
